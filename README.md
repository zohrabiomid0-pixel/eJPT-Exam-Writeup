# eJPT-Exam-Writeup
My eJPT (eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester) exam experience and preparation
## Exam Assessment Methodologies

The eJPT exam evaluates practical penetration testing skills across multiple domains.  
My preparation focused on the following assessment methodologies, supported by hands-on TryHackMe practice.

---

### Web Application Penetration Testing
This area focuses on identifying and exploiting common web application vulnerabilities, understanding application logic, and performing manual testing.

**Skills practiced:**
- Web enumeration
- Input validation testing
- Authentication and access control issues
- File inclusion and command execution vulnerabilities
- **TryHackMe rooms used for preparation:**
- Neighbour
- IDE
- MD2PDF
- ColddBox: Easy
- Overpass
- Ignite
- Easy Peasy
- Simple CTF
- Basic
### Host & Networking Penetration Testing
This methodology focuses on attacking systems through exposed network services, identifying vulnerable services, and gaining initial access.

**Skills practiced:**
- Network discovery and scanning
- Service enumeration
- Exploiting vulnerable services
- Initial foothold techniques

- **TryHackMe rooms used for preparation:**
- VulnNet: Internal
- Kenobi
- Blue
- Ice
- Blaster
- Bounty Hacker
- Bolt
- Summit
- Vulnversity
- ### Host & Networking Auditing
This area focuses on post-exploitation activities, system enumeration, and identifying security weaknesses within compromised hosts.

**Skills practiced:**
- Linux and Windows post-exploitation
- Privilege escalation fundamentals
- Credential discovery
- System misconfiguration analysis
- **TryHackMe rooms used for preparation:**
- LazyAdmin
- RootMe
- Startup
- Anthem
- Brooklyn Nine Nine
- Lian_Yu
- Anonymous
- Mr Robot CTF
- Infinity Shell
- Break Out The Cage
- Corridor
- Develpy
- The eJPT exam allows 48 hours to complete the hands-on lab assessment. I completed the labs in approximately 6 hours and achieved a final score of 85%. The minimum passing score for the exam is 70%.

This experience highlighted how important it is to practice and prepare well before taking the exam. If the required score is not achieved on the first attempt, the exam must be retaken, so consistent hands-on training really makes a difference.

Best of luck to everyone preparing for the eJPT, and happy hacking! 🚀🛡️
